/*
Dig:
Time Capsule: contains a random letter from the past with some goodies. Who left this underground?

Treasure chest. Arrr me hearties. We've left ya some booty to seek and plunder, yarrr!

Silver coin: well maybe we can exchange this obsolete coin for something useful!

Fossil: you've made a big discovery! Maybe if we get enough of these we can have our very own dinosaur!

Hunt:
Bear: we're going on a bear hunt. We're going on a bear hunt. We're gonna catch a big one, we're gonna catch a big one

Dodo bird: apparently these things are not extinct in this part of the multiverse. Let's hunt them to extinction once more!

Fox: get out of my farm, you crooks! If I see you scallywags in here again, I'll hunt ye down, every last one of you!

Wolf: think twice or maybe three times because once you hunt one of these, the entire pack has a bounty on your head.

Crocodile: well well well, if it isn't the whippersnapper
